## One last thing

Before running the development server add the following to your `.env` file: (Create an .env file in the root of the application directory if it does not exist)

```bash
URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Running the development server

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
    cd application/ && npm run dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
    cd application/ && pnpm run dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```bash
    cd application/ && bun run dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The development server should reload upon any file changes. You may need to stop and restart the server upon changes to any configuration files
