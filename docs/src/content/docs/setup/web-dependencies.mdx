## Information
This project has a couple of web dependencies. We will go through the process of setting up each one

## Supabase

### Project Setup + Environment Variables

*This step is only required if you will be working on any protected page routes or if you will be working on the database*

This project uses Supabase both to host the PostgreSQL database and to handle authentication

<Steps>

1. Create a Supabase project

    [supabase.com/dashboard/new](supabase.com/dashboard/new)

    Make sure to not forget the database password you set. You will need it in the next step!

2. Find your database connection string (Project Settings -> Database) and add it to your code

    Create a a file named `.env` at the root of the `application` subfolder and add your connection string to it

    *Make sure to replace the password placeholder of the databse url value copied from Supabase with your actual password for the database*

    ```bash
    DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_db_connection_url
    ```

3. Find your Supabase url and anon public key (Project Settings -> API) and add it to your code.

    In the existing `.env` file you created in the previous step, add the url and anon public key. Your `.env` file should now look like this

    ```bash
    DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_db_connection_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    ```

4. Setup the database schema

    run the following command
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit push
    ```

5. Set up Google OAuth Integration

    You've completed Supabase setup for now. Move on to the next section to learn how to set up Google OAuth

</Steps>

### Google OAuth Integration

<Steps>

1. Create a new Google Cloud project

    [console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

2. Set up the OAuth Consent Screen

    [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)

    - Under Authorized domains, add your Supabase project url (the same one that's in your `.env` file)
    - Add the following (non-sensitive) scopes
        - `.../auth/userInfo.email`
        - `.../auth/userInfo.profile`

3. Set up API credentials

    [console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

    - Click `Create Credentials` and choose the `OAuth Client ID` option
    - Select `Web Application` as the application type
    - Add http://localhost:3000 to the `Authorized JavaScript origins` field
    - Add your Supabase callback URL (Supabase Project Dashboard -> Authentication -> Providers -> Google -> Callback URL) to the `Authorized redirect URLs` field
    - When you finish configuring these credentials, you will be given a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`. Add these to the Google Auth Provider section of your Supabase project (same place as the Supabase Callback URL)

4. Configure Allowed Supabase callback URLs

    - Go to the URL configuration section in Supabase (Supabase Project Dashboard -> Authentication -> URL Configuration). In `Site Url`, add `http://localhost:3000` and in `Redirect URLs`, add `http://localhost:3000/**
` and `http://localhost:3000`

</Steps>

## Last.fm API

*This step is only required if you will be working persona generation features*

This project uses the last.fm API to get user data which is then fed into the OpenAI API to generate a persona

<Steps>

1. Generate a last.fm API key

    Go to [www.last.fm/api/accounts](https://www.last.fm/api/accounts), create an account if you havent already, then create an API key

2. Add the API key to your code

    Find the `API Key` value for your API account and add it to your '.env' file

    ```bash
    LASTFM_API_KEY=your_lastfm_api_key
    ```

</Steps>

## OpenAI API

*This step is only required if you will be working on persona generation features*

<Steps>

1. Create an OpenAI account

    Go to [platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and create an account if you don't already have one.

    Upon verifying your phone number in your [profile](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile). You should recieve $5 in API credits that you can use. If you don't recieve the credits, you can contact me at naya.singhania@gmail.com and I can temporarily provide you with a API key to use.

2. Create an API key

    Go to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create an API key. Add it to your `.env` file. Your `.env` file should now look like this

    ```bash
    DATABASE_URL=your_supabase_db_connection_url
    LFM_API_KEY=your_last_fm_api_key_if_applicable
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_if_applicable
    ```

</Steps>
